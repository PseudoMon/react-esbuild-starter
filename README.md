# React + ESBuild + Sakura Starter
A starter template for React. Because sometimes I just straight up forget how to set these things up.

Run `pnpm install` to set up, the usual. I prefer PNPM, but any package manager will work. Run `pnpm run dev` for local development. You can access the site through `localhost:8000`. It should also be available to everyone on the network, check your command line.

Run `pnpm run build` to build! Everything you need should be in the `dist` directory. Note that the bundled css has the same name and is located in the same directory as the bundled JS. I'm uhh not sure how to save it in a different directory yet.

The included CSS is [Sakura by oxalorg](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura), which I just think looks neat.
